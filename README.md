## 1. How do you determine if a number is a palindrome?
### Python Solution [palindrome.py](/python/palindrome.py)
#### Usage:

```
python palindrome.py <list value as arguments>
```
- e.g

```
python python/palindrome.py 34 44 676 009 0 free stits 12.21
```
- Output

```
Value: 34 --> Not Palindrome
Value: 44 --> Palindrome
Value: 676 --> Palindrome
Value: 009 --> Not Palindrome
Value: 0 --> Palindrome
Value: free --> Not Palindrome
Value: stits --> Palindrome
Value: 12.21 --> Palindrome
```
## 2. How do you reverse a string?
### Python Solution: [reverse_string.py](/python/reverse_string.py)
#### Usage:

```
python reverse_str.py <list value as arguments>
```
- e.g

```
python python/reverse_string.py 34 44 676 009 0 free stits 12.21
```
- Output

```
Value: 34 --> Reversed as: 43
Value: 44 --> Reversed as: 44
Value: 676 --> Reversed as: 676
Value: 009 --> Reversed as: 900
Value: 0 --> Reversed as: 0
Value: free --> Reversed as: eerf
Value: stits --> Reversed as: stits
Value: 12.21 --> Reversed as: 12.21
```
## 3. Find the number of occurrences of a character in a String?
### Python Solution [char_occurence.py](/python/char_occurrence.py)
#### Usage:

```
python python/char_occurrence.py <char> <string>

```
- e.g

```
python python/char_occurrence.py 2 333323
```
- Output

```
The char '2' appeared 1 time(s) in the string '333323'.
```
## 4. How to find out if the given two strings are anagrams or not?
### Python Solution [anagrams.py](/python/anagrams.py)
#### Usage:

```
python python/anagrams.py <string_a> <string_b>

```
- e.g

```
python python/anagrams.py  "I'm a dot in place." "A decimal point"
```
- Output

```
'I'm a dot in place.' and 'A decimal point' are anagrams

```
eg.2
```
python python/anagrams.py  "njagi ndungo" "omar njagi"
```
- Output

```
'njagi ndungo' and 'omar njagi' are not anagrams

```
## 5. How do you calculate the number of vowels and consonants in a String?
### Python Solution [cons_vow.py](/python/cons_vow.py)
#### Usage:

```
 python python/cons_vow.py <string_a> <string_b>

```
- e.g

```
 python python/cons_vow.py "aba" "sugar" "osama bin laden" "smooth sailor" "muslimah"
```
- Output

```
aba has 2 vowels and 1 consonants.
sugar has 2 vowels and 3 consonants.
osama bin laden has 6 vowels and 7 consonants.
smooth sailor has 5 vowels and 7 consonants.
muslimah has 3 vowels and 5 consonants.
```
eg.2
```
 python python/cons_vow.py
```
- Output

```
No arguments provided
```
## 6. How do you get the matching elements in an integer array?
### Python Solution [matching_elements.py](/python/matching_elements.py)
#### Usage:

```
python python/matching_elements.py <a list of integers>

```
- e.g

```
 python python/matching_elements.py 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 6 7 8 9 10
```
- Output

```
The elements [5, 6] have a match in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
```
eg.2
```
 python python/matching_elements.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
- Output

```
The array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] has no matching elements.
```
eg.3
```
 python python/matching_elements.py
```
- Output

```
Please input a list of integers.
```
eg.4
```
 python python/matching_elements.py a 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1q
```
- Output

```
The array [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] has no matching elements.
```
## 7. How would you implement the bubble sort algorithm?
## 8. How would you implement the insertion sort algorithm?
## 9. How do you reverse an array?
### Python Solution [anagrams.py](/python/anagrams.py)
#### Usage:

```
python python/reverse_array.py <arr_item_a> <arr_item_b> ...

```
- e.g

```
 python python/reverse_array.py
```
- Output

```
please input an array in list form, with items separated in spaces
```
eg.2
```
python python/reverse_array.py 2
```
- Output

```
The array [2] is reversed to: [2]
```
eg.3
```
 python python/reverse_array.py 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
- Output

```
The array [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] is reversed to: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]
```
