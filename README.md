## 1. How do you determine if a number is a palindrome?
### Solution one(Python) -> [Palindrome](DSA/python/palindrome.py): Checks if any given value is a palindrome
#### Usage:

```
python palindrome.py <list value as arguments>
```
- e.g

```
python palindrome.py 34 44 676 009 0 free stits 12.21
```
- Output

```
Value: 34 --> Not Palindrome
Value: 44 --> Palindrome
Value: 676 --> Palindrome
Value: 009 --> Not Palindrome
Value: 0 --> Palindrome
Value: free --> Not Palindrome
Value: stits --> Palindrome
Value: 12.21 --> Palindrome
```
## 2. How do you reverse a string?
### Reversing any value in python: [reverse file](DSA/python/reverse_string.py)
#### Usage:

```
python reverse_str.py <list value as arguments>
```
- e.g

```
python reverse_str.py 34 44 676 009 0 free stits 12.21
```
- Output

```
Value: 34 --> Reversed as: 43
Value: 44 --> Reversed as: 44
Value: 676 --> Reversed as: 676
Value: 009 --> Reversed as: 900
Value: 0 --> Reversed as: 0
Value: free --> Reversed as: eerf
Value: stits --> Reversed as: stits
Value: 12.21 --> Reversed as: 12.21
```
## 3. Find the number of occurrences of a character in a String?
### Python --> [char_occurence.py](/python/char_occurrence.py)
#### Usage:

```
python python/char_occurrence.py <char> <string>

```
- e.g

```
python python/char_occurrence.py 2 333323
```
- Output

```
The char '2' appeared 1 times in the string '333323'.
```

## 6. How do you get the matching elements in an integer array?
## 7. How would you implement the bubble sort algorithm?
## 8. How would you implement the insertion sort algorithm?
## 9. How do you reverse an array?
## 10. How would you swap two numbers without using a third variable?
## 11. Print a Fibonacci series using recursion?
## 12. How do you find the factorial of an integer?
## 13. How do you reverse a Linked List?
