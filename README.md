## How do you determine if a number is a palindrome?
### 1. Solution one(Python) -> [Palindrome](palindrome.py): Checks if a number is a palindrome
#### Usage:

```
python palindrome.py <list numbers as arguments>
```
- e.g

```
python palindrome.py 3 234 121 456 789 787 34443 569
```
- Output

```
Number: 3 --> Palindrome
Number: 234 --> Not Palindrome
Number: 121 --> Palindrome
Number: 456 --> Not Palindrome
Number: 789 --> Not Palindrome
Number: 787 --> Palindrome
Number: 34443 --> Palindrome
Number: 569 --> Not Palindrome
```
